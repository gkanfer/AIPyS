The new AIPS layout will have global segmentation initially, followed by basic Bayesian categorization, switching later to cellpose segmentation and concluding with pytorch CNN phenotypic cell identification. 
0) Images with extremely low or high standard deviation will be ignored
1) To differentiate the forehead from the background, we will utilize global classification.
1.1. By using the threshold_local function from skimage.filters module with a float input named offset_cyto with typical values ranging from 0.001 to 0.9, we will segment the image globally. 
1.2. The opening function will help us generate a mask.
2) The granularity_cellprofiler module will operate kernel subtraction based on the granCalc function.
2.1. Our target image will go through the classification process.
3) Bayesian model construction will then proceed, harnessing the intensity info.
4) Weâ€™ll run steps 0-3 to identify which part of the image is most likely to have phenotypic cells. 
5) The crop input image will depend on the image slice with the highest likelihood.
6) Cellpose will further segment this image.
7) Lastly, we'll use Pytorch for image categorization.
