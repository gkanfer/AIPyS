Tutorial notebooks
==================

Developed AI-Powered Photoswitchable Genetic CRISPR Screen, Version 2. Utilized Numpy, scikit-image, scipy for cell detection, U-net/cGAN for segmentation, PyMC3 for Bayes' Logistic Model, and Bayesian inference for sgRNA abundance analysis. Published online using Plotly-Dash for users to interact and visualize results.
The project is divided into two steps. The first step involves segmentation, training classifiers, and simulating enrichment analysis. The second step is deployment.
