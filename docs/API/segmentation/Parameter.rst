Parametric object segmentation
------------------------------
Parametric object segmentation is a computer vision technique used to identify and segment objects in cell images. It works by fitting a set of parameters to a given image or set of images. This allows the user to define the shape, size, and location of objects in the image. The objects can then be easily identified and segmented from the background. In cell biology, parametric object segmentation is used to identify and segment individual cells, nuclear material, and other subcellular components. It is also used to quantify and measure the shape, size, and location of the identified objects.
