The updated strategy seeks to accelerate the cell segmentation-classification. It involves dividing the process into three phases. The initial phase entails rough segmentation and classification to generate a probability map, aiding in pinpointing the regions likely containing phenotype cells. The subsequent phase involves segmenting these areas with cellpose, while the final phase focuses on achieving high-precision segmentation using CNN.
