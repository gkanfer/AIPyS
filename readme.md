# AI Powered Photoswitchable Screen (AIPyS) Version 2

![AIPyS Logo](https://github.com/gkanfer/AI-PS/raw/master/logoAIPS.png)

## Introduction

AIPyS V2 is an AI-driven platform enhancing the capabilities of photoswitchable genetic CRISPR screen technology. Utilizing advanced algorithms like **U-net** and **cGAN** for segmentation and employing Bayesian inference for differential sgRNA abundance analysis, AIPyS offers precise detection of single cells and subcellular phenotypes in microscopy images. It integrates Numpy, scikit-image, and scipy for parametric object detection and leverages the PyMC3 library for statistical modeling. For interactive data exploration and visualization, the platform is deployed online via Plotly-Dash.

For detailed insights, visit the [Documentation](https://gkanfer.github.io/AIPyS/).

## Quick Installation Guide

AIPyS supports Windows environments and necessitates Python 3.8. For seamless operation with machine learning components like PyTorch and Cellpose, please align CUDA and cuDNN versions meticulously.

- **Conda Installation**: Conveniently install using the provided `environment.yml` to configure both Python and CUDA/cuDNN dependencies accurately.
    ```bash
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    conda activate aipys_env
    ```

- **PIP Installation**: For environments where Conda is unavailable, use pip while ensuring correct CUDA/cuDNN configurations.
    ```bash
    pip install AIPySPro
    ```

Check installation:
```bash
aipys --version
```

Troubleshooting advice and extended installation instructions are available in our [Installation Guide](#).
